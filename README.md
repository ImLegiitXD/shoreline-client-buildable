### **Credits**  
- **[this guy](https://github.com/Skitttyy/shoreline-client)** â€“ for the src  

~~# TO MAKE BUILDABLE:~~
~~this src doesnt include the loader because my bestie bon55 made it so i didnt leak loader but the loader contains the event bus
u need to skid event bus from public shoreline or make own event bus~~
